## About

It also provides appropriate messages for each category.

## How it works
The program starts by asking the user to input their weight and height. These values are then used to calculate the BMI using the formula:

BMI = weight / (height ^ 2)
After calculating the BMI, the program uses a series of conditional statements to determine which category the calculated BMI falls into. Based on this information, the program displays the BMI value and its corresponding category.
